"Software Engineer, Full Stack",Candid Health,"New York, NY",1 month ago,"What we do

We’re fixing one of the most broken and costly pieces of the US healthcare system: medical billing.

Today, healthcare providers spend over $250B each year on administrative overhead just to get paid by insurance. Medical billing is expensive because it’s nuanced and hard - maybe ~100x harder than credit card payment processing - and because it’s traditionally done by armies of humans who track and manage complex rules and processes specific to individual insurance companies with little or no supporting software.

We’re rethinking medical billing from the ground up, building software backed by best-in-class data science (and, soon, a dash of machine learning) to automate much of this complexity so healthcare providers can get paid dramatically more easily and inexpensively.

We were in the Y Combinator W20 batch and have since been well funded by a world-class group of funds (8VC, First Round Capital, BoxGroup) + angel investors. We're now helping our customers treat opioid addiction, provide holistic care for women, lose weight, increase access to mental health care, and much more. This is such important and gratifying work; we can't wait for you to join our team and help support some of the most important innovation happening in healthcare today!

Our values

We spend at least as much time with our coworkers as we do with our closest friends + family - if we intend to do the most important + challenging work of our lives, it’s important that these folks energize us, support us, inspire us, and push us to do our best work. This is what you can expect of your teammates at Candid (in no particular order): - We put our customers first - We take care of each other and ourselves - We anchor on outcomes and work relentlessly and creatively to achieve them - We collectively prioritize building a diverse and inclusive workspace - We believe humility is our greatest strength - We are candid, kind, and committed - We strive to be the most prepared person in the room - We are truth seekers

Software Engineer,Warp,"New York, NY",1 month ago,"The cloud-backed terminal for individuals and teams

Warp is modernizing the command line experience to make it more intuitive and collaborative for modern developers and teams, turning the terminal into a real platform to enable engineering workflows. Our mission is to elevate developer productivity, and the team is excited to have this opportunity to radically improve a tool that every developer uses and fundamentally change how software development and devops are done.

We are looking for outstanding product-focused software engineers who want to work on re-imagining a product that we developers use every day. As an Engineer at Warp, you'll have the chance to tackle difficult technical problems. One of the main reasons there has been little innovation in this space is that, for historical reasons, the terminal/shell division makes it hard to innovate. You'll get to work on a fast moving project right from day one! Also, as a foundational member of our early team, you'll be instrumental in shaping our company culture and long-term engineering practices.

🎥 Here's a quick 3-min video of Zach Lloyd, our founder and CEO, giving an overview of the product and the company: https://www.loom.com/share/b2824d2c8cd649faa466d6ca2a770939





At Warp, we are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive, and authentic workplace. So if you're excited about this role, but your past experience doesn't align perfectly with every qualification in this job description – we encourage you to apply anyways! We are a community of curious learners, and most of us are learning some skills for the first time (like our engineers learning to program Warp in Rust). You might be just the right candidate for this or other roles.


Total compensation at Warp consists of two parts: 1) a competitive base salary, and most importantly, 2) meaningful equity.

When we find the right person, we try to put our best foot forward with an offer that excites you. We consider what you'd like to be paid, the skills and level of experience you bring, what similar jobs pay, and make sure there's equal pay for equal work among those you'll be working with. The budgeted compensation amount for this role is targeted at $145,000 - $260,000.

In addition to salary, all employees receive further compensation in the form of equity in the company. This is a meaningful stock option grant with a four-year vesting period and one-year cliff. Your equity is where most of the significant upside potential is. Comparing startup equity is always a bit tricky, so we're happy to walk you through different valuation scenarios at the offer stage in order to help paint a clearer picture of the upside.

Final total compensation is determined by multiple factors including your experience and expertise and may vary from the amounts listed above.





We are a company run by product-first builders, building a core product for all developers. We are committed to understanding our users deeply. We believe we will ultimately build the best product and business if that team includes developers and designers from a wide range of backgrounds. The early team comes from Google, Dropbox, Gem, LinkedIn, and Facebook. We are looking for passionate individuals to join us and help bring Warp to the world.

We value honesty, humility, and pragmatism, and our core product principle is focusing on the user. If you're interested in learning more about our company values and what our engineering team culture is like, please take a look at our internal How We Work guide.

We're very fortunate to be backed by a great group of venture capital firms. In October 2021, we closed a $17M Series A ($23M total raised), led by Dylan Field (Co-Founder and CEO, Figma). Other investors include Google Ventures, Neo, and Box Group, as well as a network of passionate angels, including Elad Gil (early investor in Airbnb, Pinterest, Stripe, and Square), Jeff Weiner (Executive Chairman and Ex-CEO, LinkedIn), and Marc Benioff (Founder and CEO, Salesforce).


Here's a quick demo showing some of our current features…

This is just the start, as our plan is to build out a set of experiences in the terminal that don't exist today like collaboration, environment sharing, rich data types and more.


The terminal is one of very few tools used by every developer every day, which makes it an ideal gateway to improving all sorts of developer activities. We believe there is an opportunity to build a unicorn-sized business improving the command-line. Our strategy is bottom-up developer adoption, followed by driving revenue through enterprise sales and distribution partnerships.

To start, our goal is to become the everyday terminal of choice with individual users – immediately usable as a backwards-compatible terminal replacement with the developer's shell of choice. We have built a closed-source server, which will implement all of the cloud-enabled features. These features will invite users to share their work with others, driving growth and encouraging collaboration. We'll also focus on building a community and an ecosystem of terminal plugins and apps, creating network effects.

At higher levels of team penetration, we will offer an enterprise plan with features around privacy, security and environment management (e.g. secure distribution and management of API keys). These larger enterprise plans will be the ultimate driver of revenue, along with potential distribution deals for companies that see CLI integrations as a way to reach new customers.

A couple college students, totally unprompted, wrote a piece on why new students should work at Warp as part of their new newsletter they are launching called ""Why You Should Join."" It's an incredibly well researched and thoughtful article about the market and competitive landscape, and accurately reflects our thesis.

Tome decodes contracts. Here's a dirty secret: everyone signs contracts without fully understanding them — even lawyers! Solving this problem with technology reinvents the $400B/year legal industry.

We empower everyone to understand their rights, understand their options, and choose the right answers for them.

Software Engineer - Frontend,Refuel,"San Francisco, CA",1 month ago,"About Refuel.ai

The Mission

The next wave of ML applications (video security, conversational AI and autonomous vehicles) is going to look very different from the last one (search and recommender systems). Teams working in these domains have to deal with large streams of unstructured data (images, video, text and audio), exorbitant labeling costs, and broken feedback loops. For this next wave of ML applications, getting to production takes months and adapting to the long tail is an existential struggle. That’s what we’re solving - Refuel.ai accelerates time to production for ML applications built on top of unstructured data, and enables them to continually improve in the real world.

The team

Refuel.ai was founded in 2021 by Rishabh Bhargava and Nihit Desai. Our founders bring machine learning and product experience from the world's leading technology companies (Facebook, Instagram, Primer.ai and Cloudera) and institutions (Stanford, Cambridge and UIUC). We are backed by General Catalyst, XYZ Ventures and a host of successful and influential angel investors from places like Stanford, OpenAI, Datadog and Facebook.

Software Engineer,Juniper Behavioral Health,"New York, NY",1 month ago,"We’re on a mission to make behavioral health more available and accessible. We're backed by a16z, YCombinator, Craft, and many others to make this dream a reality.

--



--



At Juniper, we're building software for behavioral health clinicians to improve quality of care. We streamline and replace manual efforts so clinicians can focus on what they do best: providing high-quality care.

We started Juniper because we care about impact — the lack of supply for behavioral healthcare means those who need it most cannot access it. We believe this is one of the biggest problems out there today. It’s why we’re tackling this broken industry, and why we want you on this mission with us.

For more details on our thesis, check out our write-up What is Juniper?.



Our mission to change behavioral health starts with us and and how we operate. We don’t want to just change behavioral health, we want to change the way startups operate. Here are a few tactical examples: - Diversity, equity, and inclusion has been a priority since day 1. Currently, half of our leadership team (COO + CTO) identify as female, and our cap table includes over a dozen women. We still have a ways to go, but we’re committed to sourcing, hiring, and retaining talent from underrepresented folks in tech and outside of tech. - Behavioral health is something we live and breathe — all six members of the Juniper founding team see therapists every week, and we think you should too (we have a specific benefit to help with out-of-pocket costs)! - We have to have a sense of humor. Healthcare is so broken, it's depressing if you don't laugh with us.

For more details on how we operate as a company, take a look at our FAQs | Joining the Juniper Team!



Our team is growing rapidly, and we’re looking for mission-driven engineers who care about creating positive impact, love solving challenging problems, and will thrive in the fast-paced start-up life. This person will work up and down our stack, propose and lead new projects, and help us define the company’s technical and product direction.

Software Engineer,Waldo,"Brooklyn, NY",1 month ago,"About Waldo

Waldo is the world's first no-code automated testing platform for mobile apps. Until now, testing has either been tedious and manual, or brittle and reliant on engineers scripting. We've invented an entirely new, proprietary approach that does not rely on any scripting (🤫 but under the hood, we've built an equivalent of Git for UIs so we're able to navigate application changes). With this, we can deliver the power of automation with the ease of no-code. It's an exciting challenge having no one to copy - now it's our job to lead:

Sometimes nothing will work and you'll need to conduct experiments until the root cause of the problem (either hardware or software related) is fully understood.

Before writing any code, you'll need to deeply understand complex topics and communicate proposed solutions to a highly technical team.

Software Engineer,"Finley Technologies, Inc.","San Francisco, CA",1 month ago,"Background

At Finley, we believe that today’s most innovative companies deserve financial infrastructure that can move as quickly as they can.

Startups in finance, real estate, and transportation rely on debt capital to extend loans, purchase homes, and finance vehicle fleets. But these new-school companies rely on old-school technology to manage their debt capital.

Think months of legal coordination, countless versioned Excel files passed around via email, and weeks of follow-ups—all culminating in a 200-page credit agreement that only lawyers understand, even though the future of the business depends on complying with it.

The inefficiency of this process can delay—and in some cases block—access to capital when it's needed most. It’s time for the next generation of financial infrastructure builders to rise to the challenge.

Finley’s software helps startups streamline the debt capital raise and management process. That way, they can spend more time focusing on their customers and less time worrying about fundraising.

The Role

We’re looking for Software Engineers to join our Engineering team. As an early employee, you’ll be responsible for designing, building, and testing an entirely new category of capital markets software from the ground up. You’ll architect and build the infrastructure that helps fintechs around the world collectively manage billions of dollars. Just as importantly, you’ll help shape the engineering culture and trajectory of a seed-stage startup.

We’re looking for 0 → 1 individuals who are comfortable with autonomy early on and also excited to help build structures that will scale their own impact over time. In other words, we’re looking for candidates who want to build a lasting company just as much as they want to build industry-changing software.

We believe in finding the best technology for the job, and being disciplined with only adopting the tools that actually let us move faster, build more securely, and enable a higher quality of life. We hate inefficiency and embrace debate to constantly find ways to make our lives easier and products better. Our tech stack (see below) reflects that philosophy.",https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/finley/jobs/BcIjalj-software-engineer?utm_source=syn_li

First, we deeply believe that the approach to patient care is broken for women across the country, and we’re committed to building a new care model that focuses on improving patients’ lives. There’s a lot in healthcare that’s done because “that’s how it’s always been done”, and we know that there’s a better way.

Second, you’ll be learning from a great team and you’ll be key in making this team even better.

Your coworkers have a lot of experience and we are all committed to the success of everyone at the company, and we also know that we have much to learn from each person who joins us – each of our perspectives are valuable in building this new company.

Last, as a small startup, we are offering a lot of room for you to grow in your career. We know other companies say that, but we’ve seen at other places that employees often get boxed into roles, and career paths stagnate as a result. We believe in making long-term investments in our team, and will make sure you grow your role and responsibilities in the direction that works for you and Visana.
