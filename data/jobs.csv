Software Engineer (Product),Phaidra,"Seattle, WA",1 month ago,"About Phaidra

Phaidra is building the future of industrial automation.

The world today is filled with static, monolithic infrastructure. Factories, power plants, buildings, etc. operate the same they've operated for decades — because the controls programming is hard-coded. Thousands of lines of rules and heuristics that define how the machines interact with each other. The result of all this hard-coding is that facilities are frozen in time, unable to adapt to their environment while their performance slowly degrades.

Phaidra creates AI-powered control systems for the industrial sector, enabling industrial facilities to automatically learn and improve over time. Specifically:


Our team has a track record of applying AI to some of the toughest problems. From achieving superhuman performance with DeepMind's AlphaGo, to reducing the energy required to cool Google's Data Centers by 40%, we deeply understand AI and how to apply it in production for massive impact.

Phaidra is based in the USA but 100% remote; we do not have a physical office. We hire employees internationally with the help of our partner, OysterHR. Our team is currently located throughout the USA, Canada, UK, Norway, Italy, Portugal, and India.

The Product Engineering team at Phaidra is responsible for building the tools and applications that our customers use to configure and monitor our AI-powered control systems.

We have a documentation-first culture and actively practice asynchronous communication in everything we do. Our team stays connected through tools like Slack and video chat. Most teams meet daily, and we have dedicated all-hands meetings bi-weekly to build strong relationships. We hold virtual team building events once per month - and even hold virtual socials to watch rocket launches! We have a yearly in-person, all-company summit in locations like Seattle, Athens, Goa, and Barcelona.

We provide a modern, virtual workplace that welcomes people from diverse backgrounds and viewpoints. IZEA places value on action and results. We seek individuals that thrive in a challenging and fast-evolving work environment.

Falls are the leading cause of injury-related deaths among adults over 65. At the same time, fall prevention and emergency response systems for older adults are archaic and ineffective. This issue is exacerbated by the inefficient procedures that operators of these facilities are forced to use to provide care to their residents. Sage's integrated software aims to reinvent how we care for and respond to older adults in times of need. We aim to build a platform that gives caregivers the means to provide care for modern aging.

Sage is a small, tight team of ambitious, multi-disciplinary entrepreneurs. We are a software-enabled, mission-driven company, and are focused only on the problems that are central to achieving that mission. At Sage, we work hard and fast but also know that to build a truly important company, we need to treat our work as a marathon, and not a sprint. The journey matters. We know when to slow down, take breaks, and have fun.

Customer data is the fuel that drives all modern businesses. From product analytics, to marketing, to support, to advertising, advanced data analysis in the warehouse, and even sales – customer data is the raw material for each function at a modern business.

Harnessing that customer data and getting it to the marketing and analytics tools that require it has always been a challenge….until now.

Freshpaint is a Customer Data Platform that powers the entire customer data pipeline and integrates all your tools. We make it really easy for technical teams like engineering, data, and even product to collect customer data. Then we make it really easy for business teams like product, marketing, sales, support, and more to access customer data in the tools they use day-to-day.

We do particularly well in highly regulated industries, where managing data in complex regulatory environment is...hard.

Freshpaint helps companies manage customer data with two offerings:


We’re fully remote. If you strongly value in-person work, Freshpaint is likely not the best fit for you. Even though we don’t care where you’re located, we do need employees to work US timezone hours. Many of our team is concentrated in various metro areas like SF or NYC.

To balance out our remote-ness, we gather the team 2-4 times per year for offsites. We’ve been to Greece, Jackson Hole, Cabo, Santa Fe, and California wine country in the recent past.

We’re backed by leading investors including Y-Combinator, Intel Capital, Abstraction Capital, Data Community Fund, Comma Capital, Pioneer Fund, Hustle Fund, and angel investors like the Head of Data from Slack, Head of Data at LinkedIn, and more.

Who we are:

Freshpaint was founded by web analytics veterans who noticed that the problem of collecting customer data and getting it to all the tools you need to run your business was still not solved. We started as part of Y Combinator’s S19 cohort. We launched our MVP in January 2020, and spent the rest of 2020 working with a handful of early customers to build the product. In 2021 we focused on getting our go-to-market wheels turning and scaling our customer base for the first time. We’ve increased ARR by nearly 10x in the last 12 months.

Our team has deep analytics and growth experience, with all of us coming from high-growth companies like Heap, Mixpanel, Pendo, Iterable, and Quantum Metric.

If you value lots of freedom and ownership in your work, interfacing with customers, and working on a product with high customer impact, then Freshpaint is your home.

Phaidra is building the future of industrial automation.

The world today is filled with static, monolithic infrastructure. Factories, power plants, buildings, etc. operate the same they've operated for decades — because the controls programming is hard-coded. Thousands of lines of rules and heuristics that define how the machines interact with each other. The result of all this hard-coding is that facilities are frozen in time, unable to adapt to their environment while their performance slowly degrades.

Phaidra creates AI-powered control systems for the industrial sector, enabling industrial facilities to automatically learn and improve over time. Specifically:


Our team has a track record of applying AI to some of the toughest problems. From achieving superhuman performance with DeepMind's AlphaGo, to reducing the energy required to cool Google's Data Centers by 40%, we deeply understand AI and how to apply it in production for massive impact.

Phaidra is based in the USA but 100% remote; we do not have a physical office. We hire employees internationally with the help of our partner, OysterHR. Our team is currently located throughout the USA, Canada, UK, Norway, Italy, Portugal, and India.


Who You Are

We are looking for a driven Software Engineer to be a part of our small but mighty Connectivity Engineering team. You are bold and creative, and have deep empathy for customers who may not be tech-savvy. You will design and implement significant parts of the code base and will have the opportunity to make an immediate impact with your work and guide the product and team as we grow.

Software Engineer,Seam (YC S20),"San Francisco, CA",1 week ago,"About The Role

We are looking for software engineers, preferably proficient in Typescript. We prefer people who are comfortable in full-stack role and have a couple of superhero strengths in specific parts of our stack. We play with a lot of hardware and spend a lot of time thinking about developer UX. We like written communications. We prefer to keep things simple and don't overthink first implementations. You should generally be curious, comfortable with unknown/experimentation, and able to move fast.

Below is a quick description of some of our projects.

Backend API

Our high-level goal is to build a device/manufacturer agnostic integration layer that connects to various devices and exposes their functionality through a simple API. This task involves integrating dozens of different IoT brands and their protocols (z-wave, zigbee, bacnet, OEM API...etc) and neatly organizing them amongst common functionality. We spend a lot of time building this part of our stack.

Client Libraries & APIs

Our customers tend to be quite technical and some of them even contribute code to our SDKs. In general, we spend a lot of time creating tools and client libraries to make interfacing their applications with devices easier. We strive to standardize device functions across brands and hide all the nasty complexity away.

Why you should join Seam

Seam is an API for controlling a wide range of IoT devices.

Today we primarily focus on door lock and access systems. Our customers span industries, such as hospitality, real-estate, or even last-mile delivery, and range in sieze from startups-in-garage to public companies.

Across the board, their goal is the same: use code to control hardware devices, and orchestrate the physical world.

Our team is made of alums from Nest, Sonder, Stanford, Apple, Latch, Berkeley, YC, and more. We shipped millions of IoT devices and built dev tools used by every developer on earth. We are advised by the amazing Bunnie Huang and backed by Tiger Global, Root VC, founders and execs at Stripe, Plaid, and Airbnb, and other amazing angels and funds.


We generally seek ""sharp minds with kind souls."" We prefer generalists over specialists; we move quickly, with purpose; we enjoy working with each other and aim to be the best.",https://boards.greenhouse.io/seam/jobs/4012223007?gh_src=9f689e2a7us

We're a talented and diverse group solving a problem faced by development team. We iterate quickly while placing the utmost importance on user experience, quality, and reliability. We push ourselves to do better every day. With tens of thousands of customers and rapidly increasing revenue, we're onto something big.


We're looking for candidates with high integrity, low ego, and an insatiable drive to learn. We use reasoned discussion and constant feedback to improve as individuals and as a company.

We especially encourage members of underrepresented groups in the tech community to apply.

Our interview process is unique to each role, and we value the candidate experience just as much as our customer experience. We hope your conversations with us reflect a thoughtful process that is illuminative, enjoyable, and respectful of your time.


Render's mission is to eliminate the undifferentiated work that goes into building software products by offering an easy-to-use, powerful cloud platform for developer teams of all sizes.

"Software Engineer, Full Stack",Candid Health,"New York, NY",1 month ago,"What we do

We’re fixing one of the most broken and costly pieces of the US healthcare system: medical billing.

Today, healthcare providers spend over $250B each year on administrative overhead just to get paid by insurance. Medical billing is expensive because it’s nuanced and hard - maybe ~100x harder than credit card payment processing - and because it’s traditionally done by armies of humans who track and manage complex rules and processes specific to individual insurance companies with little or no supporting software.

We’re rethinking medical billing from the ground up, building software backed by best-in-class data science (and, soon, a dash of machine learning) to automate much of this complexity so healthcare providers can get paid dramatically more easily and inexpensively.

We were in the Y Combinator W20 batch and have since been well funded by a world-class group of funds (8VC, First Round Capital, BoxGroup) + angel investors. We're now helping our customers treat opioid addiction, provide holistic care for women, lose weight, increase access to mental health care, and much more. This is such important and gratifying work; we can't wait for you to join our team and help support some of the most important innovation happening in healthcare today!

Full Stack Software Engineer,Sage,"New York, NY",1 month ago,"Sage is on a mission to improve the quality of life for older adults, starting with those residing in senior living facilities. Falls are the leading cause of injury-related deaths among adults over 65. At the same time, fall prevention and emergency response systems for older adults are archaic and ineffective. This issue is exacerbated by the inefficient procedures that operators of these facilities are forced to use to provide care to their residents. Sage's integrated software aims to reinvent how we care for and respond to older adults in times of need. We aim to build a platform that gives caregivers the means to provide care for modern aging.

Sage is a small, tight team of ambitious, multi-disciplinary entrepreneurs. We are a software-enabled, mission-driven company, and are focused only on the problems that are central to achieving that mission. At Sage, we work hard and fast but also know that to build a truly important company, we need to treat our work as a marathon, and not a sprint. The journey matters. We know when to slow down, take breaks, and have fun.


As a full stack engineer, you will be one of the main developers building the core platform. You will work directly with Sage's engineering leaders to design and implement features that will be used by front-line workers providing critical care, and you will have a direct impact on the direction the platform takes. Experience with full stack web development is helpful, but most important is a strong software development foundation along with an unconstrained drive to learn and grow.

This role requires close collaboration with a small team of engineers, along with our CPO and other product managers. We believe in our developers building user empathy and having first-hand experience with the environments for which they are building. At times you will have direct exposure to users of the platform and opportunities to visit facilities to see the product in action.

Some examples of the work you could be doing on any given day include the following:



These traits are essential to success in this role:


These are not essential, but are a plus:



Our headquarters are located in New York City's lively Meatpacking district, and we run the office as you would a family household. While we take our mission seriously, we definitely do not take ourselves too seriously. We have grocery orders for snacks every Monday, drink orders whenever we run low, have team lunches out at local restaurants most days of the week, and get together for ""family dinners"" where we take turns cooking (or taste-testing) for each other, among other things.

Our benefits package for employees includes competitive base compensation along with stock options. The expected annual salary for this role is between $130,000 and $190,000, depending upon the job level, which will depend on your level of expertise, your experience, and your qualifications. We feel that you should be paid well for your contributions to our mission, and that you should stand to gain as we grow and succeed. We also provide fully-paid health insurance coverage for all of our employees.",https://boards.greenhouse.io/sage49/jobs/4134513004?gh_src=495f9d874us

"Software Engineer, Full Stack",Candid Health,"San Francisco, CA",1 month ago,"What we do

We’re fixing one of the most broken and costly pieces of the US healthcare system: medical billing.

Today, healthcare providers spend over $250B each year on administrative overhead just to get paid by insurance. Medical billing is expensive because it’s nuanced and hard - maybe ~100x harder than credit card payment processing - and because it’s traditionally done by armies of humans who track and manage complex rules and processes specific to individual insurance companies with little or no supporting software.

We’re rethinking medical billing from the ground up, building software backed by best-in-class data science (and, soon, a dash of machine learning) to automate much of this complexity so healthcare providers can get paid dramatically more easily and inexpensively.

We were in the Y Combinator W20 batch and have since been well funded by a world-class group of funds (8VC, First Round Capital, BoxGroup) + angel investors. We're now helping our customers treat opioid addiction, provide holistic care for women, lose weight, increase access to mental health care, and much more. This is such important and gratifying work; we can't wait for you to join our team and help support some of the most important innovation happening in healthcare today!

Full-Stack Software Engineer,Visana Health,United States,1 month ago,"Why Work at Visana

We think there’s three great reasons to work at Visana Health, and we hope all of these reasons resonate with you.

First, we deeply believe that the approach to patient care is broken for women across the country, and we’re committed to building a new care model that focuses on improving patients’ lives. There’s a lot in healthcare that’s done because “that’s how it’s always been done”, and we know that there’s a better way.

Your coworkers have a lot of experience and we are all committed to the success of everyone at the company, and we also know that we have much to learn from each person who joins us – each of our perspectives are valuable in building this new company.

Last, as a small startup, we are offering a lot of room for you to grow in your career. We know other companies say that, but we’ve seen at other places that employees often get boxed into roles, and career paths stagnate as a result. We believe in making long-term investments in our team, and will make sure you grow your role and responsibilities in the direction that works for you and Visana.

Software Engineer,Warp,"New York, NY",1 month ago,"The cloud-backed terminal for individuals and teams

Warp is modernizing the command line experience to make it more intuitive and collaborative for modern developers and teams, turning the terminal into a real platform to enable engineering workflows. Our mission is to elevate developer productivity, and the team is excited to have this opportunity to radically improve a tool that every developer uses and fundamentally change how software development and devops are done.

We are looking for outstanding product-focused software engineers who want to work on re-imagining a product that we developers use every day. As an Engineer at Warp, you'll have the chance to tackle difficult technical problems. One of the main reasons there has been little innovation in this space is that, for historical reasons, the terminal/shell division makes it hard to innovate. You'll get to work on a fast moving project right from day one! Also, as a foundational member of our early team, you'll be instrumental in shaping our company culture and long-term engineering practices.

🎥 Here's a quick 3-min video of Zach Lloyd, our founder and CEO, giving an overview of the product and the company: https://www.loom.com/share/b2824d2c8cd649faa466d6ca2a770939





At Warp, we are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive, and authentic workplace. So if you're excited about this role, but your past experience doesn't align perfectly with every qualification in this job description – we encourage you to apply anyways! We are a community of curious learners, and most of us are learning some skills for the first time (like our engineers learning to program Warp in Rust). You might be just the right candidate for this or other roles.


Total compensation at Warp consists of two parts: 1) a competitive base salary, and most importantly, 2) meaningful equity.

When we find the right person, we try to put our best foot forward with an offer that excites you. We consider what you'd like to be paid, the skills and level of experience you bring, what similar jobs pay, and make sure there's equal pay for equal work among those you'll be working with. The budgeted compensation amount for this role is targeted at $145,000 - $260,000.

In addition to salary, all employees receive further compensation in the form of equity in the company. This is a meaningful stock option grant with a four-year vesting period and one-year cliff. Your equity is where most of the significant upside potential is. Comparing startup equity is always a bit tricky, so we're happy to walk you through different valuation scenarios at the offer stage in order to help paint a clearer picture of the upside.

Final total compensation is determined by multiple factors including your experience and expertise and may vary from the amounts listed above.





We are a company run by product-first builders, building a core product for all developers. We are committed to understanding our users deeply. We believe we will ultimately build the best product and business if that team includes developers and designers from a wide range of backgrounds. The early team comes from Google, Dropbox, Gem, LinkedIn, and Facebook. We are looking for passionate individuals to join us and help bring Warp to the world.

We value honesty, humility, and pragmatism, and our core product principle is focusing on the user. If you're interested in learning more about our company values and what our engineering team culture is like, please take a look at our internal How We Work guide.

We're very fortunate to be backed by a great group of venture capital firms. In October 2021, we closed a $17M Series A ($23M total raised), led by Dylan Field (Co-Founder and CEO, Figma). Other investors include Google Ventures, Neo, and Box Group, as well as a network of passionate angels, including Elad Gil (early investor in Airbnb, Pinterest, Stripe, and Square), Jeff Weiner (Executive Chairman and Ex-CEO, LinkedIn), and Marc Benioff (Founder and CEO, Salesforce).


Here's a quick demo showing some of our current features…

This is just the start, as our plan is to build out a set of experiences in the terminal that don't exist today like collaboration, environment sharing, rich data types and more.


The terminal is one of very few tools used by every developer every day, which makes it an ideal gateway to improving all sorts of developer activities. We believe there is an opportunity to build a unicorn-sized business improving the command-line. Our strategy is bottom-up developer adoption, followed by driving revenue through enterprise sales and distribution partnerships.

To start, our goal is to become the everyday terminal of choice with individual users – immediately usable as a backwards-compatible terminal replacement with the developer's shell of choice. We have built a closed-source server, which will implement all of the cloud-enabled features. These features will invite users to share their work with others, driving growth and encouraging collaboration. We'll also focus on building a community and an ecosystem of terminal plugins and apps, creating network effects.

At higher levels of team penetration, we will offer an enterprise plan with features around privacy, security and environment management (e.g. secure distribution and management of API keys). These larger enterprise plans will be the ultimate driver of revenue, along with potential distribution deals for companies that see CLI integrations as a way to reach new customers.

Software Engineer,Claim,"Boston, MA",1 week ago,"Why you should join Claim

You should join Claim for the people.

We aspire to build the best team of the 2020s. Just like PayPal in the 90s, Google in the 00s, and Stripe in the 10s, we want to be known as ""a place where it's good to be from."" If you join us, we promise to be the best place to grow your career — with the best people you've ever worked with.

There's a reason this section is at the top: it's the most important to us. If it's the most important to you too, we hope you'll keep reading.

What we're building



Trading is a fundamental part of the human experience, and nearly everyone has found ways to trade with friends — whether its Pokemon cards, limited-edition sneakers, or magic swords in a video game.

We’ve built Claim to become a “Venmo for things” — a way to trade real-world items with friends, starting with rewards at brands like Sweetgreen, Glossier, and Nike.

With Claim, you earn rewards from brands you care about (and new ones we think you’ll like). You can also trade these rewards with friends, leveling up that free coffee to anything on the platform — from a free bowl at Sweetgreen to Taylor Swift tickets.

For brands, Claim is the best way to acquire a new customer. We’ve built a rewards experience that users love, and as a result, Claim can change consumer spending much more effectively than incumbents like Instagram, TikTok, or Google. We believe that in ten years most brands will use rewards instead of advertisements — and we’re building Claim to be the default platform.

Our team

We’re a close-knit team that’s ready to change consumer internet.

The best way to learn about us is by reading our culture doc here — we wrote this document together, and we’ve updated it as the company has grown.

Who you are

You are an engineer who wants to ship code and contribute to a great engineering team. At Claim, we care deeply about building the best team of the 2020s, and we know that early teammates set the culture years into the future. You should have a perspective on what makes great code and what makes a great team — and you should care deeply about holding both code and teams to a high standard.

You have shipped software for at least five years, and you’re ready to take end-to-end responsibility for a codebase. You know what makes a frictionless user experience, and you’re excited to ship code to production.

You are comfortable building early-stage products and taking action with imperfect information. Our industry is changing rapidly, and we need to respond to change without running in circles. You should be comfortable adapting rapidly while remaining focused on a goal.

You bring a unique perspective to the team. We want anyone in the world to be able to use Claim, so we approach diversity and inclusion seriously and thoughtfully. We recognize that bringing together different perspectives and backgrounds helps build stronger teams and products.

What you specialize in



As a small startup, we’re prioritizing candidates with 5+ years in software engineering.

Nice to Haves

Seed-stage companies can offer some of the most challenging, invigorating, and rewarding experiences in technology — quite simply, Claim is different from Big Tech. It helps if you’ve experienced the ups and downs of startup life before, but so long as you’re excited for an adventure, we’re excited to have you join.

The majority of our stack uses TypeScript, and while you don’t need to be a language expert, it helps to be familiar with how to define types in TypeScript and how to debug compiler errors.

Our mobile client uses React Native, so it helps to have professional experience working with React, including features like hooks, prop types, and render efficiency.

Our backend primarily uses Node, so it helps to be familiar with features like async/await, error handling, and API design.

Our API endpoint uses GraphQL and Apollo Server, so it helps to be familiar with features like fragments, directives, and batched queries.

What you'll do

You’ll merge your first PR. We want our developer experience to be as smooth as possible, so this first day is a good test of how we’re doing on dev ops. The code changes will be very minor — just adding your name to a file and merging it to the main branch.

You’ll ship your first feature to production. We believe in learning-by-doing, so we’ll assign you a small feature that lets you run through our full feature planning and development pipeline. We’ll make sure you have support at every step along the way.

You’ll assume responsibility for a part of the backend codebase. Claim has an ownership culture, so as soon as you’re familiar with a core service, we’ll put you in charge of that part of the codebase.

You’ll help ship code across the backend, from services to CI/CD. As an early-stage startup, we have high-impact features all across our codebase, and you’ll be able to build solutions wherever the need arises.

You’ll become a senior leader at Claim, either as a manager or an individual contributor. We expect the early team to grow into high-impact roles as the company scales.

How we interview

We lean heavily on prior experience, demonstrated ability, and references. We don’t want to have brilliant people inverting binary trees or solving riddles.

We start the interview process with a discussion of your prior experience and goals for joining Claim. If we think there’s a potential fit, we’ll have a second interview with a deep dive on your prior experiences.

After the interview stage, we ask for three references who would be willing to discuss their experiences working with you. We’ll make sure to be respectful of their time; most calls take about 15 minutes.

We’ll give you access to Claim’s codebase and ask you to build a small feature (note: all candidates build the same feature). We see this final step as an opportunity for both sides to decide if we enjoy working together, and we’ll compensate you for your time.

This part’s on us, and we promise to move fast.

How to apply

FAQs



Claim is a distributed company with our center of gravity in Boston/NYC. Every two months, we fly the company into the same city for an in-person sprint.



Our mobile client uses React Native and our backend server uses Node (all TypeScript). For dataintensive tasks, we use FastAPI and Jupyter (all Python). You don’t need to know all these technologies to join the team, but it certainly helps if you’re familiar with them.



We’re excited to hire early-career teammates as we scale, but right now we’re solving for fast, high-quality execution with high ownership, so we aren’t hiring interns in the near future.



Not yet, but soon. Please check back in a few weeks or follow us on Twitter and LinkedIn.



All our roles are full-time. Things move very quickly in the early days of a startup, so it's important all team members are full-time and able to respond to issues as they arise.
